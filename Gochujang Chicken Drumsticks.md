# Gochujang Chicken Drumstick

I have been cooking more while sheltering in place. I saw a picture of Gochujang-marinated drumsticks while on Instagram and got inspired since I have a lot of Gochujang paste left to use in my fridge.

**Serving Size:** 4

### Ingredients

* 8-10 chicken drumsticks about 2 lbs, depending on size
* 1/4 cup Gochjang (Korean fermented chili paste)
* 2 Tbsp soy sauce
* 2 Tbsp mirin (or rice wine)
* 2 Tbsp sugar
* 2 Tbsp sesame oil
* 4 cloves garlic minced

### Instructions
1. Whisk Gochujang, soy sauce, mirin, sugar, sesame oil, and garlic in large bowl. Using a measuring cup, scoop 1/3 cup into a small bowl and set aside. The reserved sauce will be used for the glaze later on.
2. Score chicken and add to the large bowl. Mix well and set aside for 15 minutes to marinate. Preheat oven to 350F/175C.
3. On a baking sheet, add chicken drumsticks in an even layer. Place in the oven to bake.
4. After 15 minutes, brush the extra Gochujang sauce as a glaze. Keep brushing evey 5 minutes or so until the chicken is fully cooked, about 25-30 minutes. When the chicken is fully cooked, broil for 5-8 minutes to get those charred, crispy bits.
5. Garnish with sesame seeds and green onion (optional). Serve immediately or at room temperature.
