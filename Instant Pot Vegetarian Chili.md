# Instant Pot Vegetarian Chili

Tasty, simple instant pot vegetarian chili that is good served alone or with other additional toppings.

**Serving Size:** 6-8

### Ingredients

* 2 medium yellow onions
* 1 green bell pepper
* 1/4 cup olive oil
* 1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds
* 3/4 cup brown or green lentils
* 28 oz diced fire roasted tomatoes
* 28 oz can crushed fire roasted tomatoes
* 2 cups vegetable broth
* 1.5 tsp kosher salt
* 1 tsp onion powder
* 1 tsp garlic powder
* 1 tbsp oregano
* 2 tsp cumin, divided
* 3 tbsp plus 1 teaspoon chili powder
* 15 oz can kidney beans
* 15 oz can black beans
* 2 medium or 1 large garlic clove, grated
*For serving (optional): sour cream, shredded cheese, hot sauce, cilantro, sliced green onion

### Directions

1. Dice the onions. Dice the pepper.
2. Turn on Saute mode and add the olive oil to the Instant Pot. When it is heated, add the onion pepper, and fennel seeds and saute for 6 to 7 minutes until translucent. Add the lentils, tomatoes, broth, kosher salt, onion powder, garlic powder, oregano, 1 teaspoon cumin, and 3 tablespoons chili powder. Lock the lid of the Instant Pot. Place the pressure release handle (vent) in the "Sealing" position.
3. Press the Pressure Cook button, making sure the "High Pressure" setting is selected, and set the time. Note that it takes about 15 minutes for the pot to "preheat" and come up to pressure before it starts cooking. (During cooking, avoid touching the metal part of the lid.)
4. Vent the remaining steam from the Instant Pot by moving the pressure release handle to "Venting", covering your hand with a towel or hot pad. Never put your hands or face near the vent when releasing steam. Open the pressure cooker lid.
5. Drain and rinse the beans. Stir in the beans, grate in the garlic, and add the remaining 1 teaspoon chili powder and 1 teaspoon cumin. Put the Instant Pot on Saute mode and stir for 5 minutes, then serve. Taste and season with additional salt and fresh ground pepper as necessary.
6. Load up with toppings, as they provide the final flavoring!
