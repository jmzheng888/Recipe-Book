# Mr. Egerter's Teriyaki Salmon Recipe

After I had graduated from Mudd, a few of my friends went on a small backpacking trip in Point Reyes. Before heading out, my friend Risa's dad made us an amazing dinner, including this salmon!

**Serving Size:** 3

### Ingredients

* 3 salmon filets
* 1 onion
* 4-5 garlic cloves
* 1.5 cups mushroom

* 1 lemon
* A little bit of teriyaki sauce

### Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F.
2. Create a crimped aluminum foil bag for the salmon. Cook the salmon for about 20 minutes for an inch of salmon.

6. Take out the salmon from the oven and squeeze the lemon.
