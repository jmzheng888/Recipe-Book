# Shredded Baked Potatoes

This is my favorite potato recipe. My mom makes it every Thanksgiving! It combines a lot of great ingredients -- potatoes, bacon (!), onions and cheese -- what could go wrong?

**Serving Size:** 6

### Ingredients

* 6 medium russet potatoes

* 1/2 white or yellow onion
* 1/2 pack of bacon
* Approx. 1-2 tbsp butter
* Parmesan cheese (optional)
* Salt and pepper to taste

### Directions

1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil, then add in the potatoes (with their skin).
2. Take out the potatoes when they are halfway done, after about 10-15 minutes. You should be able to pierce through the potato.
3. Rinse the potatoes with cold water and peel off the skin, if easy to do.
4. Put the potatoes immediately in the fridge. Leaving the potatoes out will likely turn the potatoes purple (which is odd but doesn't affect taste).
5. While the potatoes are cooling, dice the onion and bacon.
6. Once the potatoes have cooled, peel off the skin if you have not done so earlier and thread the potatoes.
7. Preheat the oven to 375&deg;F (or some range between 350&deg;F to 400&deg;F )
8. In a pan, cook the bacon fully and remove the excess oil.
9. Add in the onions in the pan and cook until the onions are light brown.
10. Add in the potatoes, butter, salt and pepper to taste. Cook until the ingredients are fully mixed.
11. Oil a casserole dish and add the potato mixture in. Place it in the oven.
12. Let the potatoes cook for 30-45 min or until golden brown on the top. Optional: Before the potatoes are fully golden brown on the top, add cheese and let it melt.
13. Enjoy!
